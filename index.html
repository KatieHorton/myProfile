                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a 33 year old lady interested in web development. I have always wanted a skill set, but could not decide which one was for me.  Then one day, I saw a documentary about numbers and data.  I became very interested in code, and decided to try it out.  I've been studying code with <a href="http://codecademy.com"/target="_blank">CodeCademy</a> for several months, and I absolutely love all the organization of code in this crazy world. I'm a mother of two and enjoy family hikes, coffee, cartoons, and documentaries. </p>
